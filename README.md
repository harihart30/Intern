# Week-1-Edunet
 # Crop Recommendation System

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to recommend suitable crops based on soil properties and weather conditions. Using data on factors like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, pH, temperature, and rainfall, the model predicts crops such as rice, maize, and others.

## Features
- **Input Data**: Soil (N, P, K, pH) and weather (temperature, rainfall) parameters.
- **Output**: Predicted crop recommendation.
- **Goal**: Aid in precision agriculture by providing data-driven crop suggestions.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## Usage
Run the provided Jupyter Notebook (`crop.ipynb`) to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.
